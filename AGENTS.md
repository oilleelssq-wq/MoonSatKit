## Project Structure

- MoonBit packages are organized per directory; each directory contains a
  `moon.pkg` file listing its dependencies. Each package has its files and
  blackbox test files (ending in `_test.mbt`) and whitebox test files (ending in
  `_wbtest.mbt`).

- In the toplevel directory, there is a `moon.mod` file listing module
  metadata.

## Coding convention

- MoonBit code is organized in block style, each block is separated by `///|`,
  the order of each block is irrelevant.

- Try to keep deprecated blocks in file called `deprecated.mbt` in each
  directory.

## Tooling

- `moon fmt` is used to format your code properly.

- `moon info` updates generated package interfaces.

- `moon test` runs the test suite across supported targets.

- Prefer `assert_eq` or `assert_true(pattern is Pattern(...))` for stable
  values, and keep numerical tolerances explicit.
